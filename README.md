# AmpliTube: YouTube audio on-the-go
AmpliTube is a web app that allows you to search YouTube and listen to the audio track only. This conserves your device's precious battery life and data (if on mobile) because unlike the official mobile app, you
1. don't have to keep the display on
2. only download the audio track, which is almost guaranteed to be smaller in filesize than the video track.
